*Features (GAME)*
- * conveyor belt
- * let players choose sprites (w/ interact button or left/right)
- level designer (exports level file)
- add nickname labels over players
- visually show gamepad controls
- allow multiple people cutting item to go faster
- require players to mark ready before starting
- cook items on stove (save cook status on pot, as it can be moved)

*Features (MULTIPLAYER)*
- use nicknames for players names in multiplayer
- give socket users uuids instead of using nicknames
- improve multiplayer room ui

**Still Needs Syncing**
- points
- orders (should be completly on server)
- status of item being cut

*Issues*
- local pages won't load with trailing /
- controller disconnect not handled
- (multiplayer) players not removed from room on page reloaded/dulpicated
- (multiplayer) interact key needs to be spammed to cut items
- (multiplayer) others cannot continue cutting item
  - for both above, move all cutting progress data under an object so it can be transferred
- can trash plates, pot (just remove items inside for containers)

*Changelog*


**Planning**
- have items of type container that can hold other items
  - examples of containers are plates and pots
